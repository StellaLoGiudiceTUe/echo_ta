# Cognitive emergent states
#level1 
For example SMMs and transactive memory systems. These states facilitate anticipation and coordination, which in turn positively affects effectiveness. For example teams with good shared mental models act in sync under pressure.

From kozlowski ilgen 2006
Four primary content domains of team mental models were originally proposed (Cannon-Bowers et al., 1993). They include:
(a) **Equipment model**: Knowledge about the equipment and tools used by the team.
(b) **Task mental model**: Understanding of the team task, including its goals, performance requirements, and problems.
(c) **Team-member model**: Awareness of team-member composition and resources, including representations of what individual members know and believe, as well as their skills, preferences, and habits.
(d) **Team-interaction model (or teamwork schema)**: What team members know or believe about appropriate or effective processes.
