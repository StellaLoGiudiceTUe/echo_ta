# Eliciting requirements
The process of _discovering and gathering the requirements of a system_ from stakeholders (users, customers, domain experts, etc.) and other information sources. This involves identifying the system’s environment and stakeholders, understanding business objectives, and acquiring information about what the system must _do and be constrained by_. The purpose is to reveal requirements that might not be immediately obvious, deploying techniques such as interviews, workshops, scenarios, prototyping and observation.
