# Transition processes

#level1
Transition processes happen during the transition phases, which are periods of time when teams focus primarily on evaluation and/or planning activities to guide their accomplishment of a team goal or objective. During this phase, the team takes inventory of how well they performed during the previous episode and prepare for the upcoming one. Teams compare current performance levels against goals and derive performance gaps. We distinguish as typical transition processes:
-  [[Mission analysis\|Mission analysis]]
- [[Goal specification\|Goal specification]]
- [[Strategy formulation and planning\|Strategy formulation and planning]]
