# Deliver quality output
#level2 
performance measure of team effectiveness: a team is effective (partly) when it delivers quality output. Quality can be a tricky measure, but in general people tend to refer to quality output when the product demonstrably works according to specifications and is well documented (see [[Requirements specification\|Requirements specification]]).
