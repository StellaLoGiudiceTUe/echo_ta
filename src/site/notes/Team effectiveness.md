# Team effectiveness

#level0
Team effectiveness means how well a team achieves its intended goals and maintains the capacity to perform in the future.  
According to Kozlowski & Ilgen (2006), a truly effective team:

•Performs well ([[achieve goals\|achieve goals]], [[deliver quality output\|deliver quality output]])

•Maintains viability (members want to [[keep working together\|keep working together]])

•Supports member growth ([[learning and development\|learning and development]], [[satisfaction\|satisfaction]])


So when do we talk about effective collaboration? When you have all three!

Team effectiveness is an output of IMOI loops in which [[Team processes\|Team processes]] and [[Team emergent states\|Team emergent states]] construct and feed each-others.ppubli
