# Motivating or confidence building
#level2 
Generating and preserving a sense of collective confidence, motivation and task-based cohesion with regard to mission accomplishment. This includes encouraging team members to perform better or maintain performance standards. Motivation techniques include feedback on team success, "pep talks", or even imagery and modeling techniques to illustrate potential team capabilities. Please notice that often in the interviews motivation is more strictly mentioned more as "the motif to do something" and so it looks more related to creating a [[Goal specification\|Goal specification]] and [[Shared mental models\|Shared mental models]] than really pinning onto the affective aspects of motivation.
