# Requirements analysis and negotiation
This process involves _examining elicited requirements, structuring and decomposing them, checking for conflicts and inconsistencies, and resolving disagreements among stakeholders._ Negotiation ensures that stakeholders with conflicting priorities (for example, business vs. technical teams) reach a .mutually acceptable set of requirements.
**Good‑practice examples from the book of Sommerville and Sawyer:**  
- Detecting a conflict where two stakeholders want incompatible behaviour (e.g., “system must block all external access” vs. “system must allow partner access”), and facilitating negotiation to find a workable compromise.
- Refining high‑level goals into a consistent set of detailed requirements (e.g., breaking “support real‑time reporting” into specific measurable criteria).
- Applying _prioritisation techniques_ to manage limited resources, such as MoSCoW (Must have/Should have/Could have/Won’t have) style classification.
