Action processes happen during the action phases. Action phases are periods of time when teams are engaged in acts that contribute directly to goal accomplishment (i.e. taskwork). We distinguish:
- [[Monitoring progress toward goals\|Monitoring progress toward goals]]
- [[Systems monitoring\|Systems monitoring]]
- [[Team monitoring and backup responses\|Team monitoring and backup responses]]
- [[Coordination\|Coordination]]
