# Requirements documentation
Requirements documentation is writing the _formal requirement artifacts_ that record the agreed requirements in a clear, structured, and accessible way. This usually results in a **requirements document** (e.g., user requirements document or software requirements specification) that will guide design, implementation and testing.
