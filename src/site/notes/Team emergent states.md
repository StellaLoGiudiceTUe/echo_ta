# Team emergent states
#level0 
Constructs that characterize properties of the team that are typically dynamic in nature and vary as a function of the team context, inputs, processes and outcomes. They don't represent *interaction processes*, but instead they are qualities, or properties of the team. These properties can represent values, cognitions and attitudes.
Emergent states are:
[[Behavioral emergent state\|Behavioral emergent state]]
[[Cognitive emergent states\|Cognitive emergent states]]
[[Affective emergent state\|Affective emergent state]]
