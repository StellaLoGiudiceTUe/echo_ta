# Team processes
#level0
the term teamwork processes describes interdependent team activities that orchestrate taskwork (a team's interactions with tasks, tools, machines and systems) in employees' pursuit of goals. Teamwork processes are the vehicles that transform team inputs to both proximal and longer-term outcomes. To avoid construct confusion and to sharpen the conception of team process, investigators must recognize the distinctions among teamwork processes, taskwork, emergent states, and more permanent team traits and characteristics. ==NB: how to do that? We need definitions and distinctions for everything!==
