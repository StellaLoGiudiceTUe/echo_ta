# Requirements validation
Requirements validation is the process of _checking the documented requirements to ensure they truly reflect the stakeholders’ needs_ and are of high quality (complete, consistent, unambiguous, and testable). Validation techniques include reviews, inspections, walk‑throughs, prototyping and early test case definition.

**Good‑practice examples from the book of Sommerville and Sawyer:**  
- Conducting **requirements reviews** with stakeholders (including non‑technical representatives) to detect misunderstandings early.
- Defining **acceptance test criteria** early as part of the validation process to ensure each requirement can be verified.
- Building **throwaway prototypes** to uncover hidden assumptions and omissions.
