# TA leading questions:
1. Is team effectiveness perceived just as good performance, or is it relevant also for engineering teams to extend it to a all-round question of team performance, well-being and viability?
2. Are interpersonal processes the true underpinning of effective teams in engineering teams? And how do teams transition from effective to non-effective team states? What are the processes that positively influence the transition to effectiveness? ==*Something like this*==
