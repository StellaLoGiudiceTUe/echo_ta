# TA leading hypotheses:
1. Engineering team members define **project success** as *high-quality (according to specification) deliverables built within time, money and resources constraints* and they value team viability and well-being as indicators of **team success**.
2. Interpersonal processes strongly influence the success of projects and teams. **Interpersonal processes** are key for the *transition* from an effective (emergent) state to a non-effective state.  ==*Something like this*==
